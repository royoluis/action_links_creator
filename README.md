<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Imagine a group of post authors who create content every single day.</p> 
<p>They primarily use two specific Content Types ("Event" and "Multimedia") and would like to have two buttons to add content in a faster way.</p> 
<p>Let's get to work!</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <b>admin/config/development/action_list_creator</b> and select "Event" and "Multimedia"</li>

  <li>You can <b>change the link titles</b>. Let's set "Add Media" instead of "Add Multimedia" (default title)</li>
